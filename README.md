# Flutter Festival by Google Developer Students' Club-BITS Pilani

This is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe android mobile application that was created as a part of a 3-day workshop to teach students about Flutter and how to work around it.
App features:
  - Editable players' names.
  - An Undo button to revert back last move.
  - A reset button to clear all grids.
  - Both the players have their score in front of their which gets updated on corresponding win.
  - A button to randomize UI colors.
  
  
The logic of the app is kept as simple as possible for Flutter beginners.
